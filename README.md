# random_rstatscat

i`ll start my journey into github by misusing it for sharing plain images. My next repo will be proper programming, I promise.
The pixelart ist done by me, feel free to use it as you please, but keep in mind its a riff on that famous rainbow cat, which is surely is copyright protected by someone in some form.

28x28_rstatscat.png, 56x56_rstatscat.png, 112x112_rstatscat.png which should be compatible to generate twitch emotes (based on the information i found online, i did not test that)

150x50_rstatscat.png is the native size of the pixelart, 1500x500_rstatscat.jpg is scaled up with a bit of tilting and glow effects.

Thanks to all the content creators for all the great rstats learning resources! @kierisi, please say hi to jinx!
